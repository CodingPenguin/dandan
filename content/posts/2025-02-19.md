### *2025-02-19*
As I write this, I'm in **Chon Buri, Thailand**.

A month before, I was in **Tokyo, Japan**.

A month before, in **Oklahoma, US**. 

A month before, in **Los Angeles (LA), CA**.

*Yet each place is unlike any of the others.*

In Thailand, the society prioritizes food, tourism, and massages. In Japan, people are more uptight and always have somewhere to be. In Oklahoma, people praise Trump like he's a Founding Father. And in LA, everyone's the next Instagram influencer. 

Every one of these people in each of these societies had a mother and father. We all know what it feels like to lose someone we *love*, and we all *love* those close around us. 

The more I travel, the more I find how *different* each society is, but also how *similar* people are.

I don't know what I'll take away from this travel experience, but at the very least, I've grown to have more empathy for each society that I've visited.

### notes
- first things first, this is my first time writing since high school seriously.
- i'd rather make a video, but i have first-hand AND second-hand embarrassment. maybe i can convert these into scripts when i can write longer entries.
- don't stop doing this *future danny*
